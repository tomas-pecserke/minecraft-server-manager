A complete, self-hosted control panel for Minecraft servers that run as Docker containers on the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image. It aims to
rival commercial panels (Pterodactyl, Multicraft, AMP) in polish and capability while staying
entirely free and local.

**Zero paid services. Everything runs on your machine, and your entire panel is one folder you can
copy to migrate.**

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js 24+** (current LTS) for the from-source install: uses the built-in `node:sqlite` (flagless from Node 24), so there are
  **no native modules to compile**. The panel prints a clear message and exits if run on an older Node. (The Docker image bundles its own runtime.)
- **Docker**
  - **Windows:** Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend). The panel talks to `\\.\pipe\docker_engine`.
  - **macOS:** Docker Desktop (`/var/run/docker.sock`).
  - **Linux:** Docker Engine (`/var/run/docker.sock`; add your user to the `docker` group).
- A few GB of disk for server images + worlds.

The panel and the Docker daemon are expected to run on the **same host** (server data is bind-mounted
by host path).

### 🐳 Option 1: Docker (Linux hosts, Portainer, Dockge, compose)

A pre-built multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is published to GHCR on every release:
`ghcr.io/anefzaoui/minecraft-server-manager:latest` (or pin a version tag, e.g. `:v0.11.0`).
Grab the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) from the repo root, set **one** variable, and start:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/msm/data
echo "DATA_DIR_HOST=/opt/msm/data" > .env   # ABSOLUTE host path for all panel data
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://your-host:25564**. In Portainer/Dockge, paste the compose file as a stack and set
`DATA_DIR_HOST` in the stack's environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The panel drives the **host's Docker daemon** through the mounted socket, and anything that holds
> the Docker socket is root-equivalent on the host, so treat the panel's admin login accordingly and
> never expose the UI raw to the internet. Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) is not a target for this
> mode; run the panel natively there.

<details>
<summary><b>How the containerized panel works, and what to know</b></summary>

- The panel drives the **host's Docker daemon** through the mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` and creates
  each Minecraft server as a **sibling container** (not a child). Game ports are published by those
  containers directly on the host, so the panel container itself only exposes the web UI port.
- `DATA_DIR_HOST` is required and must be the **absolute host path** of the directory mounted at
  `/data`: bind mounts are resolved by the daemon against the **host** filesystem, so the panel
  re-roots every path it hands to Docker from its container-local view onto that host path. Without
  it the daemon would mount host directories that don't exist.
- The container binds to `0.0.0.0` **inside its own network namespace**; publish `127.0.0.1:25564:25564`
  instead of `25564:25564` if a reverse proxy on the host fronts the panel (then set `TRUST_PROXY` +
  `COOKIE_SECURE`).
- Features that reach a **sibling** container directly - currently just the live map (BlueMap) -
  try, in order: every Docker-network IP the sibling container has (its own container port, no
  host-port involved), then the sibling's HOST-published port via `host.docker.internal` (not
  `127.0.0.1` - that's the panel's own loopback, not the host's). Whichever answers first is
  cached. The bundled `docker-compose.yml` maps `host.docker.internal` via `extra_hosts:
host.docker.internal:host-gateway` (Docker Engine 20.10+) for the fallback path; a raw
  `docker run` or a stack tool that doesn't read `extra_hosts` from the compose file needs the
  equivalent `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag, or set `MAP_PROXY_HOST`
  yourself.
- **Reverse-proxy setups (Pangolin, NGINX, Traefik…) where a server's Docker network is set**
  (Advanced Docker Settings) for the reverse proxy to reach it directly: put the **panel**
  container on that same network too (add a `networks:` block to the panel service in
  `docker-compose.yml`, referencing it as `external: true`) so the direct container-IP path above
  actually has a route - without that, the panel falls back to the host-published-port path,
  which may not be reachable at all in a network topology built around bypassing host ports.

</details>

### 🖥️ Option 2: From source (any OS, incl. Windows/macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anefzaoui/minecraft-server-manager.git minecraft-server-manager
cd minecraft-server-manager
pnpm install               # installs deps and builds the Tailwind CSS (postinstall)
pnpm run build             # optional: also build the esbuild client-JS bundle (raw source is served otherwise)
cp .env.example .env      # optional - all values have sane defaults
pnpm start                 # or: pnpm run dev (auto-restart + CSS watch)
```

Open **http://localhost:25564**. By default the panel binds to **localhost only** (`127.0.0.1`), so it's
reachable just from this machine; set `PANEL_HOST=0.0.0.0` to reach it across your LAN. The **first run**
walks you through a system check, choosing your time zone, and creating the admin account. If Docker
isn't running you still get the full UI, and the lifecycle features light up when the daemon comes up.

> If you start with a non-loopback `PANEL_HOST`, first-run `/setup` is PIN-gated: a 6-digit PIN is
> printed to the server console and must be entered before the admin account can be created.

You do **not** need to set anything in `.env` to start: on first run the panel generates a strong
random cookie secret (`data/.session-secret`) and a separate at-rest encryption key
(`data/.secret-key`). Set `SESSION_SECRET` yourself only if you want to control it (e.g. to share one
across replicas); the at-rest key is always machine-local, so keep `data/.secret-key` with your
backups.

### ⚙️ Option 3: Under a process manager (PM2 / systemd)

For a from-source install that should survive reboots. Gotcha with **PM2**: it launches apps
with whatever Node version started the PM2 _daemon_, and later switching your shell with `nvm` does
**not** change it. A restart can silently re-launch on the old version and fail the Node-24 preflight.
Pin the interpreter per app:

```bash
pm2 start src/server.js --name minecraft-server-manager --interpreter "$(nvm which 24)"
pm2 save
```

(or `pm2 kill && pm2 resurrect` to relaunch the whole daemon under your current default Node.)

### 🌐 Option 4: Panel here, Docker somewhere else

The panel does not have to run on the machine hosting the servers. Point it at the remote daemon
and it keeps each server's files in a Docker **volume** on that machine, reaching them over the
Docker API instead of through a shared filesystem:

```bash
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.0.0.5:2375   # the daemon to drive; include the port
# SERVER_STORAGE=volume is the default for a remote DOCKER_HOST; set it explicitly to be sure.
```

What that changes:

- **Server files** (world, mods, config) live in a volume named `msm-<serverId>` on the Docker
  host. The file manager, mod installs, world tools and crash reports all work; they move bytes
  over the Docker API rather than reading a local disk.
- **Backups** are still written on the panel's machine, streamed out of the volume - so they
  survive the Docker host and need free space here, not there.
- Each server gets a small **file sidecar** container (`msm-fs-<serverId>`) while the panel is
  working with its files; it stops itself after a few idle minutes.
- `MAP_PROXY_HOST` defaults to the host in `DOCKER_HOST`, since published ports are on that
  machine. Override it if the daemon answers on a different address than the game ports.
- **Ports** are allocated against the daemon's host: the panel unions its own records with the
  ports containers already publish there. A port held by something that is not a container on that
  machine is still only caught when the container fails to start, with a clear message.
- Secure the daemon endpoint: plain `tcp://` is unauthenticated root access to that machine. Use
  TLS (`DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` + `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`), or keep the daemon on a private network you
  trust. If you want SSH, forward the daemon's port yourself and point `DOCKER_HOST` at the local
  end of the tunnel; `ssh://` in `DOCKER_HOST` is handled by the Docker client library alone and
  is not a setup the panel supports.
- Give `DOCKER_HOST` an explicit port. A port-less `tcp://host` is not the same thing here as it
  is for the `docker` CLI: the request goes to port 80, where a web server may answer instead of
  the daemon.

**What volume storage costs.** Without a shared filesystem there is no path to read, so every look
at a server's files is a command run inside that server's file sidecar. Measured against a daemon
on the same LAN, one such command costs about 80ms whether it asks for one byte or lists a whole
modpack - create the exec, start it, spawn the process - so what a page costs is the number of
commands it needs, not the work in them. A tab that only reads the database renders in about 45ms;
the worlds tab, which lists the world folders, checks each for a `level.dat` and measures them,
renders in about 130ms.

That is the price of `volume` storage, not of a remote daemon as such, and the panel is built
around it: `serverFs` batches (one command for a listing plus its sizes plus its probes, one for a
set of files), pages that only print sizes read them from the storage index instead of measuring,
and the world listing is cached for a few seconds. Keep that in mind when adding a page - a loop
that reads five files one at a time is five round trips here and free on a bind mount.

### 🪟 Windows notes

- Docker Desktop must be running before you start/create servers.
- Share your project drive with Docker Desktop (Settings → Resources → File sharing) so bind mounts
  work. The panel's Docker status endpoint tells you if the daemon is unreachable.
- Bind mounts on Docker Desktop are slower than named volumes; the panel uses bind mounts anyway
  because _portability wins_: your entire panel is one folder.

> **Time zone & region:** picked during first-run setup (auto-detected from your system) and changeable
> in Settings. All dates and player-activity times display in the zone you choose.

## Why this over Pterodactyl, Crafty Controller, or AMP?

All three are capable general game panels. This one is **purpose-built for Minecraft on the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image**, so the parts
that are fiddly elsewhere are first-class here:

- **vs [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)**: no separate Wings daemon, database server, or "egg"
  setup to run; it's one Node process talking to your Docker socket. Minecraft-specific features
  (pinned modpacks, a shared deduplicated mod library, crash forensics, portable blueprints) are built
  in, not community add-ons.
- **vs [Crafty Controller](https://craftycontrol.com/)**: same free, self-hosted spirit, but every
  server is a clean, resource-capped **Docker container** rather than a bare process, with per-server
  disk quotas, a one-click live map, and portable `.mcserver.zip` blueprints.
- **vs [AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP)**: no per-machine licence and no paid tiers. **MIT-licensed
  and free**, with the itzg image's entire environment-variable surface exposed and explained in plain
  English.

Not affiliated with any of them.

## Features in depth

**Core**

- **Multi-server lifecycle**: create / start / stop / restart / recreate / delete, with graceful
  RCON `stop` before container stop, health-aware status, and crash detection with backoff.
- **Guided wizard**: Simple mode (the common knobs) or Advanced mode exposing every environment
  variable the image supports, each with plain-English help, grouped by section, plus a raw
  `KEY=value` escape hatch. Only non-default values are applied.
- **Modpacks are always pinned**: "latest" is resolved to a concrete version id at install time and
  pinned, so the image never silently upgrades a pack on restart. Upgrades are explicit: preview →
  automatic pre-update backup → graceful stop → re-pin → recreate → health monitoring → **one-click
  rollback** if it doesn't come up. The Updates page also checks Docker-image staleness and, for
  servers with no managed pack, explicit Minecraft-version / loader-build pins.
- **Custom-mod overlay**: mods you add yourself are downloaded into a shared, sha256-deduplicated
  library and hard-linked into the server; they survive pack updates. Disabling is class-aware
  (overlay mods rename to `.disabled`; pack-managed mods use the image's exclusion mechanism).
- **Five content sources, one browser**: Modrinth, CurseForge, and (keyless) **Hangar** (PaperMC's
  plugin registry), **SpigotMC** (via Spiget's CDN proxy, which dodges the Cloudflare wall), and
  **GitHub Releases** (stable-release preference, `-sources`/`-javadoc` sidecars skipped, ETag
  caching so update checks barely touch the rate limit). All five feed search, add-by-link, the
  update checker, and the one-click updater. Quilt servers automatically accept fabric-tagged builds.
- **Add by link, from anywhere**: paste a Modrinth/CurseForge/Hangar/SpigotMC project page, a
  GitHub repo or release URL (bare `owner/repo` works), a Modrinth slug, or a direct `.jar` URL -
  the panel resolves the right build for the server's loader and MC version.
- **Server-side `.mrpack` import**: upload a Modrinth modpack and it's previewed and installed like
  a CurseForge export; files are canonicalized back into real Modrinth projects via hash lookup
  (so they stay update-checkable), client-only entries are skipped visibly, and both override trees
  apply in spec order with pre-apply backups. An `.mrpack` can also seed server creation.
- **Verified downloads**: every install from a registry is streamed through the strongest checksum
  the registry publishes (sha512 → sha256 → sha1 → md5); a mismatch aborts before anything lands on
  the server.
- **Crash analysis via mclo.gs**: one click shares a crash report as an mclo.gs paste (always behind
  an explicit confirm, since it's public) and runs mclo.gs's automated insights: known problems with
  suggested fixes, rendered right in the History tab.
- **Console, logs & RCON**: live console over WebSocket, ANSI rendering, search/level filters, a
  command bar with history, and a player list with quick actions. Every server gets a generated,
  encrypted RCON password injected automatically.
- **Player moderation**: whitelist, ops (levels 1 to 4), bans, IP bans; via RCON while running and via
  direct JSON edits while stopped ("applies on start"). Teleport by coordinates, to a player, or to
  the nearest biome.
- **Backups & schedules**: save-safe archive/restore with per-reason retention caps and free-space
  preflight; every new server is seeded a daily backup automatically, each archive is
  integrity-checked before it's recorded, and the panel's own database is snapshotted on a daily
  timer. Per-server and global cron tasks (restart / backup / RCON) with next-run previews.
- **Blueprints (`.mcserver.zip`)**: a portable recipe of an instance. Full config (secrets
  stripped), resource limits, the pinned pack reference, the custom-mod overlay manifest (source
  URLs + hashes), chosen config files, and optionally an embedded world. Import reproduces the same
  server with fresh ports and per-mod hash-verified downloads. Clone = export + import.
- **Storage analytics & quotas**: a background size-indexer walks `./data`, caches sizes, and
  panel-enforces per-server disk quotas (Docker can't cap bind-mount usage); usage breakdowns,
  largest-files, orphan detection, and trend charts.
- **History & crash reports**: every action (lifecycle, config diffs, mods, packs, backups, RCON,
  player actions, schedules) is a structured event with actor and captured log excerpts. Crash
  reports are auto-detected, parsed (exception + suspected mods), exportable, and shareable to
  mclo.gs with automated insights.
- **Accounts & two-factor auth**: multi-user with **admin / operator / viewer** roles, plus optional
  **two-factor authentication (TOTP)** for any account. Enroll with any authenticator app (Google
  Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, …), keep one-time backup codes, and reset a locked-out user as an
  admin. See the [2FA guide](docs/two-factor-authentication.md).

**Beyond the basics** (all shipped, all self-hosted)

- **Live world map**: one click installs BlueMap matched to the server's loader, allocates a port,
  and embeds it in a tab served only through the panel's authenticated proxy.
- **Analytics & scoreboard**: vanilla stats ingested on a schedule (playtime, deaths, kills,
  blocks/diamonds mined, distance), per-player profiles, and a rankable scoreboard.
- **Activity timeline**: every log line classified (chat, joins, leaves, deaths incl. PvP,
  advancements) into a searchable per-server timeline. Chat is captured locally only.
- **Inventory forensics**: read any player's inventory/armor/ender chest from playerdata NBT,
  automatic snapshots on join/death, side-by-side snapshot diffs, cross-player item search,
  give/clear via RCON.
- **Investigation**: advisory x-ray suspicion scoring from ore-discovery ratios vs the server
  median; evidence laid out, never auto-punishing.
- **Discord**: webhook notifications (lifecycle, crashes, backups, updates, player actions) with
  per-event toggles, plus an **Alerts** category (OOM, unhealthy, stalled boot, stop-failed,
  failed schedule, quota stop, offline-after-restart, crash loop) that's on by default. URLs
  stored encrypted. See the [integrations guide](docs/integrations.md).
- **Invites & client modpacks**: a paste-ready invite block plus a generated client `.mrpack` with
  the server pre-added to the in-game server list.
- **Pick-mods-first solver**: choose the mods you want; the solver intersects Modrinth metadata to
  propose the newest fully-compatible loader + MC version pair and installs the set on creation.
- **Public status page**: optional unauthenticated `/status/<slug>` per server: live status, MOTD,
  version, flavor, icon, uptime, and player count, styled with the server's accent.
- **Public API**: optional read-only `/api/v1`, authenticated with admin-minted Bearer tokens that
  are scopable per server, revocable, and expiring; server list + live status. See
  [docs/public-api.md](docs/public-api.md).

## Networking, ports & remote access

A fresh install is **localhost-only**: it answers only at `http://localhost:25564` on the machine
it runs on. This section covers how to reach it from elsewhere and exactly which ports to open.

### Ports at a glance

| What                     | Port(s)                                      | Protocol  | Open to the internet?                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Admin panel (web UI)** | `PANEL_PORT` - default **25564**             | TCP       | Only behind TLS (reverse proxy), not raw  |
| **Game server (Java)**   | from `PORT_GAME_START` (**25565**) upward    | TCP + UDP | **Yes** - this is how players connect     |
| **RCON**                 | game port **+ 1000** (from **26565**)        | TCP       | **No - never.** Panel-internal management |
| **Bedrock / Geyser**     | from `PORT_BEDROCK_START` (**19132**) upward | UDP       | Only if you run Bedrock                   |
| **Live map (BlueMap)**   | auto-allocated                               | TCP       | **No** - served through the panel's proxy |

The panel itself sits at **25564**, one below the game runway, so game instances count cleanly
upward from 25565 with nothing interrupting the sequence. Game ports are then assigned **first-free**,
one game + RCON pair per server. Ten servers therefore occupy game `25565-25574` (TCP+UDP), RCON
`26565-26574` (TCP), and, where Bedrock is enabled, `19132+` (UDP). The 1000-port RCON offset is
deliberate: it keeps RCON in a separate block so you can open a contiguous **game** range without ever
exposing RCON.

> **Why RCON must stay closed:** RCON is a plaintext remote-admin protocol guarded only by a password.
> The panel reaches it via `docker exec` _inside_ the container, so the host RCON port is never needed
> from outside. Leave `26565+` blocked at the firewall.

### Reach the panel from another machine

The panel binds to `127.0.0.1` out of the box. To listen on all interfaces, set in `.env`:

```env
PANEL_HOST=0.0.0.0
PANEL_PORT=25564
```

Restart the panel so it re-reads the environment. **Under PM2 you must pass `--update-env`**, or
PM2 keeps the old value:

```bash
pm2 restart <id> --update-env      # PM2 - --update-env is essential
# or restart however you launched it
```

Confirm the bind address actually changed:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 25564              # want 0.0.0.0:25564, not 127.0.0.1:25564
```

Then open the panel port in **both** the host firewall and, on a VPS, your provider's separate
cloud firewall (the one people forget):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25564/tcp                                                            # ufw
# sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=25564/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload  # firewalld
```

### Open game ports for players

Open a range sized to how many servers you plan to run. Game ports are **TCP and UDP**: UDP carries
the query protocol on the same port.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25565:25584/tcp
sudo ufw allow 25565:25584/udp
sudo ufw allow 19132:19141/udp     # Bedrock / Geyser - only if used
```

Do **not** add a rule for the RCON range (`26565+`).

### Do it safely (recommended)

Exposing the raw panel port on the internet means logins travel over **plain HTTP**. Prefer one of:

- **Reverse proxy with TLS**: keep `PANEL_HOST=127.0.0.1`, terminate HTTPS in front, and set
  `TRUST_PROXY=1` + `COOKIE_SECURE=auto`. Minimal [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/):

  ```
  mc.example.com {
      reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:25564
  }
  ```

  You then open only `80`/`443`, never `25564`.

- **SSH tunnel**: no exposure, no firewall change, just for you:

  ```bash
  ssh -L 25564:127.0.0.1:25564 user@your-server     # then open http://localhost:25564 locally
  ```

  .session-secret        auto-generated cookie-signing secret (keep private; delete = rotate)
  .secret-key            auto-generated at-rest encryption key (keep with backups; delete = lose
                         stored API keys / RCON passwords / TOTP secrets)
  panel.db               SQLite database (node:sqlite, WAL)
  servers/<id>/          bind-mounted as /data into each container (world, mods, configs…)

**Copy `data/` to another machine → you migrated the whole panel.** Back it up like you'd back up a
world. Every file operation is contained to this root (path-guard enforced).

## How the important things work

### Two memory limits

- **Java heap** (`MEMORY`): what Minecraft may use.
- **Container limit** (Docker `HostConfig.Memory`): the hard cap; hitting it OOM-kills the server.

Keep the container limit 25-50% above the heap, and at least 2 GB above it for a modpack. The
wizard does this automatically; the Settings form validates it.

**"Memory used" settles at the heap size. That is not a leak.** The image hands `MEMORY` to Java
as both the starting and the maximum heap, and Java fills a heap it was given up front within the
first minute of world generation, whether or not Aikar's or MeowIce's flags are on (they only make
it instantaneous). Measured on a Paper 1.21.1 server with a 2 GB heap and a fresh world, sampled
for three minutes after "Done" (each figure moved by under 50 MB in that time):

| Setting                                                       | Memory used |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Default (`MEMORY` only), with or without a flag preset        | ~2.6 GB     |
| Aikar's flags plus `-XX:-AlwaysPreTouch` in Extra JVM options | ~1.95 GB    |
| Aikar's flags plus `INIT_MEMORY=512M` ("Initial heap")        | ~1.4 GB     |
| No preset, `INIT_MEMORY=512M`                                 | ~1.25 GB    |

Turning off pre-touch only delays the fill: Java still works through the whole heap over time and
never hands it back (a Forge 1.20.1 server with a 4 GB heap and no preset read 3.7 GB after a week
with nobody on). A smaller **Initial heap** is the setting that changes what Java asks for, so that
is the lever if you want idle memory to follow real use; the trade-off is that Aikar's flags
recommend equal heaps for the steadiest tick times. Java also needs memory outside the heap: about
0.5 GB on vanilla, 1.5-2 GB on a large modpack, which is what the headroom above is for.

The panel's meters mark where the heap sits on the container-limit scale and say so. The panel
subtracts disk cache like `docker stats` does; hypervisor dashboards often do not (Proxmox counts
the VM's cache as used, and since version 9 the VM's own overhead on the host too), so a VM's
summary page can read well above the panel for the same server.

### Java version selection

The image does **not** pick Java for you. The panel maps MC version → image tag
(`java8/16/17/21/25/latest`) with a per-server override in Advanced settings.

### GT New Horizons

GTNH is installed from its own release index rather than CurseForge, and the panel always pins an
exact pack version. Java is chosen per version from the index's own `maxJavaVersion`: GTNH 2.8.0 and
later run on **Java 25** via the pack's bundled lwjgl3ify patches, older releases on Java 21 or 17.
Budget **6 GB of heap and 20 GB of disk** to start; the wizard raises both for you. See the
[modpacks guide](docs/modpacks.md) for the full pack workflow.

### Disk quotas are panel-enforced

Docker can't cap bind-mount disk usage, so a background size-indexer walks `./data`, caches sizes in
SQLite, and blocks disk-growing operations (mod installs, backups, world uploads) for servers over
quota. Optional strict mode gracefully stops a runaway server past its quota.

### Secrets at rest

API keys, RCON passwords, TOTP secrets, and the Discord webhook URL are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
using a **dedicated** random key at `$DATA_DIR/.secret-key` (auto-generated on first run, mode
`0600`). It's independent of `SESSION_SECRET`, so rotating the cookie secret no longer invalidates
stored credentials. Values written before this key existed used a `SESSION_SECRET`-derived key,
kept as a decrypt-only fallback and re-encrypted under the dedicated key automatically on boot.
**Back up `.secret-key` with your data.** Losing it means re-entering every stored credential.
Blueprints never contain secrets. The panel refuses to set footgun env vars (`REMOVE_OLD_MODS`,
`LOAD_ENV_FROM_*`).

### Password recovery

There is no self-service password reset (the panel has no email/SMTP dependency by design). If you're
locked out, stop the panel and reset the admin password with the maintenance script:

```bash
node scripts/reset-password.js <username>
```

## Security

- **Localhost-only by default**: binds `127.0.0.1` out of the box; LAN/internet exposure is an explicit opt-in.
- Session auth (SQLite-backed), async bcrypt password hashes, first-run admin setup. On an exposed
  (non-loopback) bind, first-run `/setup` is additionally gated by a 6-digit PIN printed to the
  server console.
- **Rate limiting**: a per-account login lockout (per-IP and account-global), plus per-client-IP
  `express-rate-limit` on all of `/api` (`RATE_LIMIT_API_PER_MIN`, default 1200) and on login /
  2FA / setup POSTs (`RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_15MIN`, default 100). Behind a proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY`.
- **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)**: opt-in per account (any role), with one-time backup codes and an
  admin reset path; the login rate-limit is shared across the password and code steps so a correct
  password can't reset the counter before code-guessing.
- Roles: **admin / operator / viewer**, enforced on every mutating request - including side-effecting
  GETs (event export, world download, `.mrpack`), which are gated to admin/operator (user management
  in Settings).
- `SameSite=Lax` cookies by default (`COOKIE_SAMESITE` to change) + Origin checks on all
  state-changing requests; with `COOKIE_SAMESITE=none`, writes with no `Origin`/`Referer` are also
  rejected. WebSocket upgrades check `Origin` and authenticate the session cookie. Per-request CSP
  nonces (no `unsafe-inline` in `script-src`), `X-Frame-Options`, `nosniff` on every response.
- Secrets encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, dedicated key - see above), never readable through the file
  manager. Blueprints strip secrets on export. Uploaded images are verified by magic bytes, not the
  declared content type.
- Every file path is validated against escape from `./data` (including symlinks that resolve outside it);
  archive extraction is zip-slip-guarded, size-capped, and decompression-bomb-ceilinged, and backup
  zipping runs in a `worker_threads` worker. Server-side downloads (mods, icons) are SSRF-guarded
  against private/internal addresses. The BlueMap proxy never forwards your session cookie to the map
  container.
- **Health & monitoring endpoints**: `GET /healthz` (unauthenticated liveness - checks the DB,
  returns `503` on failure, deliberately no version) and `GET /api/status/summary` (authenticated:
  current problems, recent alerts, disk free) for operators and external monitors.

## Status & areas that need work

This is an early public release. The core lifecycle is solid, but several features are
deliberately "good enough for now": honest contribution targets rather than finished work. If you
want to help, start here.

- **Custom RTP (random teleport)**: the panel's own random-teleport picks a point in a ring around
  the player and lands them on the highest solid block via `spreadplayers`. It retries a few times to
  dodge ocean/void, but there's **no real safety scan**; you can still land on tree canopy, a cave
  roof, or an exposed cliff. It's **online-only**, runs **one search at a time per server** (a
  `/locate`/`spreadplayers` sweep briefly stalls the server's main thread), seeds distance from the
  player's **last-saved** position (can be stale), and its point distribution clusters toward the
  centre rather than being area-uniform.

- **Structure finding**: nearest-structure teleport uses a bundled vanilla list plus a best-effort
  scan of the server's structure tags for modded content. Each structure's home dimension is a static
  lookup that **defaults to the Overworld**, so a modded structure that only generates elsewhere can
  fail to locate. "Surprise me" just searches from a random ring point, not a genuinely random
  structure. Online-only, same main-thread stall.

- **Biome finding**: modded biomes are only discovered on **Forge/NeoForge** (via their registry-tag
  commands). On Fabric/Quilt/Paper the picker falls back to the bundled **vanilla** biome list, so
  modded biomes won't appear, and cross-dimension biome mapping is partly heuristic.

- **Giving / taking items**: give and clear go over RCON and are **online-only**. `give` hands over a
  **plain stack, with no enchantments, custom NBT/components, names, or contents** (you can't give an
  enchanted or renamed item from the UI yet). Per-slot god-mode editing _can_ preserve component data
  offline (direct `.dat` rewrite), but a **live count change resets custom components**, and offline
  edits are refused while the player is online.

- **Item listing**: the JEI-style registry is built offline from each server's own jar lang files, so
  it works for any loader/pack, but it's **`en_us` only**, covers only `item.*`/`block.*` names, and so
  **misses datapack-added items, entities, and anything without a lang entry**. It's names + ids only,
  with **no icons/textures, NBT variants, or recipes** (not a full JEI). Listing and giving aren't fully
  wired together: you can find an item but only give its plain form.

- **Live map (BlueMap)**: one-click install works, but it only takes effect on the **next restart**,
  only manages `accept-download: true` (no in-panel render/marker/storage config), supports a **fixed
  set of server types**, and the map's web server is bound on all host interfaces. Reach it **only**
  through the panel's authenticated proxy and **don't open that port in your firewall** (binding it
  loopback-only is on the list).

- **General**: much of the god-mode surface is **online/RCON-first** with thinner offline paths;
  several version-specific assumptions (1.20.5 item components, 1.21.5 `equipment` layout) are
  confirmed only against a handful of versions and may drift; and there's no automated end-to-end
  coverage of these live-server flows yet beyond the manual `pnpm run test:smoke` sweep.
