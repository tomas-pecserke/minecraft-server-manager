# Architecture

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

Minecraft Server Manager is a single-process, server-rendered Node.js application. It manages
Minecraft servers that run as Docker containers using the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image, talking to the
Docker daemon over its API (never by shelling out to the `docker` CLI).

## Runtime shape

- **Express + Handlebars** render pages server-side. There is no SPA; the browser JS in `public/js/`
  is hand-written progressive enhancement. An esbuild step (`pnpm run build:js`) bundles and
  minifies it into `public/dist/js/`; the app serves that bundle when it's present and the raw
  source otherwise, so a dev run without a build still works.
- **`node:sqlite`** (built into Node; the panel requires Node ≥ 24) is the database - synchronous,
  zero native modules, WAL mode. A small versioned-migration runner applies `src/db/migrations/*` on
  boot. Prepared statements are cached in `src/db/index.js` keyed on the SQL text.
- **`ws`** carries the live console and stats streams. Both are **brokered**: one upstream
  `docker logs --follow` (or `docker stats`) per server, demuxed once and fanned out to every
  connected tab, rather than one upstream per viewer. The console broker keeps a small replay
  buffer for late-joining tabs and drops a subscriber whose socket falls too far behind rather than
  stalling the shared stream.
- **dockerode** is the only way the app talks to Docker. The endpoint is auto-detected per platform
  (Windows named pipe vs. unix socket).
- **All persistent state lives under one directory** (`$DATA_DIR`, default `./data`). Copying that
  directory migrates the entire panel.

## Layering

Dependencies flow in one direction:

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   HTTP  ───────▶│  web/routes/*  (+ middleware)│   parse & validate input, shape responses
                 └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                                │
                 ┌──────────────▼──────────────┐
                 │         services/*          │   domain logic (the actual features)
                 └───┬─────────┬─────────┬─────┘
                     │         │         │
        ┌────────────▼──┐ ┌────▼────┐ ┌──▼──────────┐
        │   docker/*    │ │  db/*   │ │  storage/*  │   infrastructure
        └───────────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

- **`web/routes/`** - one router per domain (`servers`, `players`, `worlds`, `crashes`, `blueprints`,
  `files`, …), mounted in `web/app.js`. Routers validate with zod, call a service, and return JSON
  or render a view. Business logic does not belong here. Two routers are mounted in the **public
  zone**, before `requireAuth`: `routes/status.js` (opt-in per-server HTML status pages) and
  `routes/apiV1.js` (`/api/v1`, a read-only JSON API authenticated by an admin-minted Bearer token
  from `services/apiTokens.js`, off unless enabled in Settings; see `docs/public-api.md`).
- **`services/`** - the heart of the app. Each service owns one domain and may depend on
  infrastructure and on other services.
- **`docker/`** - dockerode wrappers: `connect` (endpoint detection + daemon health), `containers`
  (create/start/stop/recreate with bind mounts, memory/CPU limits, and labels), `logs`, `stats`,
  `images`, and a `watcher` that turns Docker events into history + crash detection.
- **`db/`** - the SQLite wrapper and migration runner.
- **`storage/`** - the `./data` bootstrap, the **path guard** (`safeJoin`, the file-safety
  backbone), `serverFs` (the one way anything reaches a server's files, see below), and the
  background size-indexer + quota enforcement.

Cross-cutting:

- **`config/`** - environment config plus the **field catalog**: the single source of truth for
  server settings. Every itzg environment variable is catalogued (label, help, type, unit, default,
  validation, section, danger flags). The wizard, settings forms, and zod validation are all derived
  from it, so exposing a new setting is a data change, not new UI plumbing.
- **`events/`** - `recordEvent()` is the one entry point for the history log; lifecycle events also
  capture container-log excerpts to `data/logs/<id>/events/`.
- **`ws/`** - authenticated console + stats WebSockets (session cookie verified on upgrade, `Origin`
  checked to block cross-site hijacking), brokered per server (see "Runtime shape").
- **`logger.js` + `instrument.js`** - `require('./logger')(label)` returns a per-module
  [Pino](https://getpino.io) logger; level from `LOG_LEVEL`, `makeFailureThrottle()` keeps a
  persistently-failing background loop to one log line plus a "recovered" line.
  `src/utils/logSanitize.js` redacts credential-shaped keys and webhook tokens from the structured
  metadata; `src/config/logLevel.js` is the shared level allowlist (kept separate to avoid a
  require cycle with `config`). `src/instrument.js` is a dormant Sentry seam, loaded first in
  `src/server.js`. `src/web/middleware/requestLog.js` writes one access-log line per request
  (skipping `/healthz` and static assets). ESLint enforces `no-console` under `src/**`, with
  `preflight.js`, `instrument.js`, and `config/index.js` exempt (they run before the logger exists).
- **Rate limiting** - `src/web/middleware/rateLimit.js` puts `express-rate-limit` in front of `/api`
  (`RATE_LIMIT_API_PER_MIN`, default 1200) and the login / 2FA / setup POSTs
  (`RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_15MIN`, default 100); `0` disables a limiter. It keys on `req.ip`, so
  `TRUST_PROXY` matters behind a proxy. `/api/v1` has its own per-token limiter
  (`RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_API_PER_MIN`, default 120), keyed on a hash of the Bearer token with an IP
  fallback. A separate per-account soft counter in
  `src/web/middleware/auth.js` handles the login lockout (per-IP and account-global, decaying).

## Where a server's files live

A server's `/data` is reached through **`src/storage/serverFs.js`**, never through a path built by
hand. It has two backends, chosen by `SERVER_STORAGE`:

- **`bind`** (default on a local daemon) - the files are `data/servers/<id>` on the panel's own
  disk, bind-mounted into the container. Every call is a plain `fs` call.
- **`volume`** (default when `DOCKER_HOST` names a remote daemon) - the files are a Docker named
  volume, `msm-<serverId>`, on the daemon's host. The panel has no path to them, so it works
  through a **file sidecar**: a container (`msm-fs-<serverId>`, `src/docker/sidecar.js`) that
  mounts that volume and nothing else. Reads and writes go through the Docker archive API, listings
  and moves through `docker exec`. It starts on first use and stops (without being removed, so the
  next use only has to start it) after `SIDECAR_IDLE_SECONDS`; boot removes only the ones whose
  server no longer exists.

The handle (`serverFs.for(serverId)`) is the same either way: `readFile`/`writeFile`,
`readdir`/`walk`/`stat`/`statMany`, `rename`/`copy`/`remove`, `readStream`/`writeStream`,
`uploadFile`/`uploadDir`/`downloadFile`/`downloadDir`, `du`/`duTree`, and `grepFiles`. Paths are
relative to the server's data directory and are containment-checked on both sides - the remote
backend re-checks inside the sidecar, so a symlink a mod plants cannot lead a read out of the mount.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Code that needs a **real path** (NBT readers, zip readers) uses `withLocalCopy` /
  `withLocalDir`, which materialise a temp copy under `data/tmp` and delete it afterwards. Use
  them for single files or small subtrees, never for a whole world.
- **Backups always land on the panel's disk**, streamed out of the volume as a tar and zipped here.
  A remote server's archives therefore live on - and need free space on - the panel's machine.
  Restore reverses it: extract here, park the volume's current contents inside the volume, upload,
  then drop the parked copy.

`serverFs.forLocalRoot(abs)` gives the same interface over a panel-local directory (the library,
the admin file manager's `DATA_DIR` scope). Only a server's `/data` ever moves to another host.

**Ports** follow a remote daemon rather than this machine too: `services/ports.js` probes a local
socket only when the daemon is local; otherwise it unions the panel's own records with the ports
containers already publish on the daemon's host (`daemonPortsInUse()`), since binding a socket here
would say nothing about a machine somewhere else.

`DOCKER_HOST` is handed to dockerode as-is; the panel adds no transport of its own. An `ssh://`
endpoint is therefore whatever the client library makes of it, which is a fresh connection and
re-authentication per API call - unusable for the file traffic this panel generates. Reach a remote
daemon over `tcp://` (with TLS, or across a port forward you set up yourself), and give it a port:
a port-less `tcp://host` resolves to port 80, not to 2375.

### What volume storage costs

Every read of a server's files becomes an exec in that server's sidecar. Measured against a daemon
on the same LAN, one exec costs ~80ms regardless of what it asks for - create, start, attach, plus
the process spawn inside the container - so the count of round trips, not the work per round trip,
is what a page's render time is made of. A tab that only reads the database renders in ~45ms; the
worlds tab, which lists the world dirs, probes each for `level.dat` and measures them, renders in
~130ms. This is the cost of reaching files through the Docker API rather than of the daemon being
remote; `bind` storage pays none of it. Three design rules follow, and the code sticks to them:

- **Batch by default.** `serverFs` exposes `statMany`, `readdirMany`, `readMany` and
  `readdirSized` (a listing, its per-entry sizes and per-child file probes in one exec) precisely
  so a page costs one round trip rather than one per file. A new caller that loops over paths is a
  bug on a remote host.
- **Never walk when the index will do.** The size indexer already stores per-directory sizes;
  pages that only display numbers (the metrics tab) read those instead of measuring live.
- **Cache the repeated reads, briefly.** `server.properties` (2s) and the per-server world listing
  (5s, dropped by every world operation) collapse a page render - and the reload behind it - into
  one round trip.

A new caller that ignores these reads as fast on a bind mount and crawls on a volume, which is why
`serverFs` is the only door to a server's files.

## Key domain behaviors

- **Modpacks are always pinned.** The image auto-upgrades unpinned packs on every restart, so the
  panel resolves "latest" to a concrete version id at install time and pins it. Upgrades are an
  explicit orchestrated flow (`updates/`): preview → pre-update backup → graceful stop → re-pin →
  recreate → health-monitor → one-click rollback.
- **The custom-mod overlay** is panel-managed: user-added mods land in the deduplicated library and
  are hard-linked into the server so they survive pack updates. Disabling is class-aware.
- **Ports** are allocated from a base scheme (game from `PORT_GAME_START` upward, RCON = game +
  `PORT_RCON_OFFSET`, Bedrock from `PORT_BEDROCK_START`), probed for availability, and reserved in
  the DB.
- **Disk quotas** are enforced by the panel because Docker can't cap bind-mount usage: the indexer
  caches per-directory sizes and disk-growing operations are gated on them.
- **Secrets** (RCON passwords, API keys, TOTP secrets, the Discord webhook URL) are encrypted at
  rest with AES-256-GCM using a dedicated random key at `$DATA_DIR/.secret-key` (mode `0600`,
  auto-generated). It's independent of `SESSION_SECRET`; a `SESSION_SECRET`-derived key is kept as a
  decrypt-only fallback for values written before the dedicated key existed, and
  `src/services/secretsMigration.js` re-encrypts those under the dedicated key once on boot.
  A `.secret-key` that exists but doesn't parse is a hard boot error (it is never silently
  regenerated over the top). Blueprints strip all secrets on export.
- **`server.properties` is panel-owned but env-shadowed.** The itzg image re-asserts every
  env-backed property on each start (`OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES` defaults true), so a value the
  panel edits directly - World Controls PvP/difficulty, the whitelist toggle, the Files editor -
  would be silently reverted on the next start unless the matching env var is removed and the
  container recreated. Every direct property write goes through `writeServerProperties()` (whole
  file) or `setServerProperty()` (one key) in `src/services/servers.js`, which atomically rewrite
  the file, un-set the env var behind each changed key (via the `prop:` attribute on catalog
  fields, checked in tests against the image's own property definitions), and flag
  `pending_recreate`. Difficulty is written to the file as well as sent over RCON, because a
  dedicated server re-applies the `difficulty` property on every boot. Minecraft itself re-saves
  server.properties from its boot-time values on `whitelist on/off`, which would undo edits made
  while the server runs, so the running whitelist toggle snapshots the file first and writes it back
  with only `white-list` changed. The env
  vars stay fully configurable at creation (the wizard renders them and they apply once); they only
  un-pin the first time the panel edits the underlying property. MOTD is the same contract: a direct
  `motd` file edit un-sets it, so the last write wins.

## Data & wire formats

- **`data/panel.db`** - the SQLite database. Snapshotted daily via `VACUUM INTO` to
  `data/backups/_panel/` (newest 14 kept); `PRAGMA integrity_check` runs on boot.
- **`data/.session-secret`** - the auto-generated cookie-signing secret, created on first run if
  `SESSION_SECRET` is unset. Deleting it rotates the secret (which invalidates sessions).
- **`data/.secret-key`** - the dedicated 32-byte at-rest encryption key (mode `0600`), auto-created
  on first run. Independent of `SESSION_SECRET`; deleting it makes every stored credential
  undecryptable, so it belongs with your backups.
- **Blueprints (`.mcserver.zip`)** - a zip with a `manifest.json` describing config, resources, the
  pinned pack reference, the overlay manifest (source URLs + sha256), chosen config files, and
  optionally a world. Import re-downloads and hash-verifies each mod and assigns fresh ports.
- **Docker containers** created by the panel are named and labelled so the watcher can find them;
  the panel owns their full lifecycle.

## Boot sequence

1. `require('./instrument')` (the Sentry seam) before anything else, then `require('./preflight')`
   to fail clearly on an unsupported Node version.
2. Load config; ensure/generate `.session-secret` **and** `.secret-key`.
3. `ensureDataRoot()` - create the `./data` layout, wipe `tmp/`.
4. Run DB migrations, then `PRAGMA integrity_check` (logs loudly, points at `data/backups/_panel`
   on failure).
5. Re-encrypt any legacy `SESSION_SECRET`-keyed secrets under `.secret-key` (`secretsMigration`).
6. Seed starter blueprints (guarded).
7. Start the HTTP + WS server. On an exposed bind, print the first-run `/setup` PIN.
8. Install the post-boot runtime guard (catches uncaught faults; `MSM_EXIT_ON_FATAL=1` makes it
   hard-exit for supervised deployments).
9. Start background services: WS broker, storage indexer, crash + inventory watchers, scheduler,
   Discord event bridge, and the **daily maintenance timer** (prune old analytics rows + snapshot
   `panel.db`).
10. Initialize Docker **in the background**. The UI is fully usable while the daemon is down;
    Docker features light up when it becomes reachable. Once connected, `refreshStatuses({ boot })`
    reconciles cached statuses, emits a one-time `offline-after-restart` event for a server that was
    up before the panel restarted and won't be brought back, and the boot loop starts
    `auto_start` servers plus recovers `auto_restart` servers found crashed during the outage
    (respecting crash-loop backoff).

## Build pipeline

`pnpm run build` = `build:css` (Tailwind → `public/css/app.css`) + `build:js` (esbuild →
`public/dist/js/`, ESM with code-splitting). `postinstall` runs **CSS only**. `public/css/app.css`
and `public/dist/` are gitignored build artifacts; the Dockerfile build stage runs the full
`pnpm run build` and copies `public/` into the runtime image. Static assets are served
`immutable`/long-cache for fingerprinted files, short-cache for CSS/JS, and `no-cache` for HTML and
`/api`.
